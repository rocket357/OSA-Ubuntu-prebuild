# OSA-Ubuntu-prebuild
Scripts to configure br-mgmt, br-storage, br-vlan, br-vxlan, etc... along with corosync/pacemaker for HA LB VIPs and openstack-ansible.  Tested on Ubuntu-16.04 with OSA Pike.

These scripts are WIP and targeted to a specific network configuration.  See the comments at the top of "setup-ips.sh" for additional information.
